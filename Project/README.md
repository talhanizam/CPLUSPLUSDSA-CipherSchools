Binary Search Tree (BST) Project
This project implements a basic Binary Search Tree (BST) in C++. It includes functionality for inserting nodes, searching for nodes, deleting nodes, and performing inorder traversal of the tree.

Files
BST.cpp: The main source code file containing the implementation of the BST.
input.txt: A sample input file for testing the BST operations.
output.txt: The output file generated after running the program (usually not included in the repository, but included here for reference).
How to Compile and Run
Compile the Code: Use a C++ compiler like g++ to compile the BST.cpp file.
g++ -o BST BST.cpp
