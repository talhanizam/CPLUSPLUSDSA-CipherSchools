Binary Search Tree (BST) Project
This project implements a basic Binary Search Tree (BST) in C++. It includes functionality for inserting nodes, searching for nodes, deleting nodes 
and performing inorder traversal of the tree.

Files
1. BST.cpp: The main source code file containing the implementation of the BST.
2. input.txt: A sample input file for testing the BST operations.
3. output.txt: The output file generated after running the program (usually not included in the repository, but included here for reference).


How to Compile and Run
1. Compile the Code: Use a C++ compiler like g++ to compile the BST.cpp file.
      g++ -o BST BST.cpp
